# Machine Learning and Data Science Framework ;

    >_ Different type of problems have different types of solution frameworks...


# 1. Problem Definition ;
        >_      What kind of problem it is...

        1_ Supervised Learning

        2_ Unsupervised Learning

        3_ Transfer Learning

        4_ Reinforcement Learning


# 2. Data ;
        >_ What kind of data does it have ?

        1_  Structured Data

        2_  Unstructured Data

                A_  Static Data
                        >_  Comma Separated Values ( .CSV Files)

                B_  Streaming Data
                        >_ When static data is ready for implementation, It has to be updated regularly & it becomes Streaming data...


# 3. Evaluation ;
        >_  What defies success, 95% or 99% or 90% of accuracy...

    
# 4. Features ;
        >_  What do we already know about data ?

        >_  Is it numerical or catagorical feature ?


# 5. Modeling ;
        >_ Three Parts of modeling ;
                1. Choosing & Training a Model,  (Training Data)
                2. Tuning a Model,               (Validation Data)
                3. Model Comparison,             (Test Data)

        # Part-I ;
                >_  Model the data into 3 sets indivisually (Training Data: 70, Validation Data: 15, Test Data: 15), Don't feed the test data directly because, It's a learning process...
                >_  Choose a model according to your problem.

        # Part-II ;
                >_  Tuning the hyperparameters for better performance...

        # Part-III ;
                >_  Comparing the different models with their performance.
                >_  Compare apple to apple, not apple to orange..
                >_  Underfitting & Overfitting both aren't good, this isn't an exam, isolate your test data from training data to work better in the real world problems...


# 6. Experinments ;
        >_  Don't be afraid to test, It's like a ML model learn by mistakes just as humans.
        >_  It's the way of learning,"Learn By Doing, Experinmenting", Try -> Failed -> Retry -> Retry -> Some Success -> 90% Success -> Perfection is a myth..
        >_  Use the right frameworks & tools because, here solving the problem matters only...





# "Use the right & modern tools" ;
        >_ Tools are like the key to any problem, If you want to learn about computers, you must have a computer first.
        >_ Using tools like, anaconda, numpy, jupyter notebooks, tensorflow, scikit learn, pytorch, pandas, matplotlib, XG-Boost, Cat-Boost, etc..
